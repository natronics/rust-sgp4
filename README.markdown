_Simplified perturbations models_ are a set of models used for satellites and objects relative to the Earth-centered inertial coordinate system. These are often referred to collectively as **SGP4** because of how popular that particular code is and how it's used with nearly all low Earth orbit satellites.

The SGP4 and SDP4 models were published as FORTRAN IV in 1988. It has also been ported to C. This is a port to [Rust][rustlang].
